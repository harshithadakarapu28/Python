"""Question: Triple Machine Sync â€“ Real-Time Alert System
In an industrial automation setup, three different machines are programmed to emit alert beeps at regular intervals:
Machine A beeps every a seconds.
Machine B beeps every b seconds.
Machine C beeps every c seconds.
All machines start beeping simultaneously at time t = 0.
As a system engineer, your task is to:
Determine the first time after 0 when all three machines will beep together again.
Given a total observation period of n seconds, determine how many times all three machines will beep together within that time frame."""
